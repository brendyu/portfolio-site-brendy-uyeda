                The objective is to develop a mental health app that supports users in journaling, organizing therapy appointments and medication, setting goals, and fostering healthier habits.

                    Research
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Primary research was conducted to discover the needs of people when it comes to mental health. This was done through a series of user interviews, with questions aimed at what participants currently do to maintain their mental health, and their obstacles.

                    Ideation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    From the initial research, I was able to organize the data gained into two groups, both with differing needs. One persona, Drew, has a more casual need for a space where he can quickly jot down his thoughts. The other persona, Kerry needs an app to remind her when to take her medication, and keep notes while she is in therapy calls.

                    Lofi Wireframes
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After brainstorming, Lo-Fi wireframes were created to get a sense of what primary features and screens would look like. These wireframes underwent usability testing to get further data on how effective the initial design was, or how ineffective certain parts were.

                <p>
                    After several rounds of usability testing, I got to finalizing the color palette and overall UI of the app.

                <p>
                    The overall branding of the app includes a color palette that is synonymous with words like “vintage” and “comfy” with the decision to use a serif font for the app.
